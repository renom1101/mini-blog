Two years ago I saw it for the first time and was astonished by its majesty, I didn't even thought about ever climbing it, it would sound crazy and ridiculous.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For the last year I'm seriously hooked up by climbing and all the perks it brings for my personal growth. And when one month ago @Ignas randomly told me \"Hey, it may sound crazy, but what do you think about climbing Matterhorn?\" I just almost without hesitations said \"Fuck, that is crazy indeed! Let's do it!\". Oh, and by the way, season is going to an end, so we should do it in a month or wait for the next year. \"Of course, let's do it this season!\". Few days after that we bought plain tickets and started preparation to make this dream come true.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The idea to climb it was scary and we didn't really know what to expect, but both of us were too much psyched about this idea so we just started preparation for it. Month had passed very quickly, did a lot of climbing in the gym, cycling, roller skating, simulating hikes in Lithuanian forests, I even started to practice yoga almost daily. Moreover we did one weekend trip to Tatra mountains for Krivan peak to become as much prepared physically as possible. We also had to learn lots of alpine climbing techniques, how to become rope jedi, how to prepare for bad weather conditions, how to use crampons, ice axes, how to acclimatise properly and many other exciting alpine survival stuff. In a month scary dream became into quite confident feeling that we actually going to make it real.`}</p>\n    <p>{`And so the journey started. Our initial plan was to make three climbs: one easy ascent for the beginning to get used to the rocks and overall feeling, then acclimatise by hiking at high altitude over the glacier and then wait for the good weather to assault the Matterhorn.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It was a bit snowing the first day, but the weather was still good enough to play around a bit, so we decided to stick to the plan and take a Riffelhorn peak. The ascend was relatively easy, but it was a very good playground to climb around, get used to new gear, get some confidence climbing together and just enjoy the magnificent view of the alps.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Another day had come and this time prepared more seriously for two day glacier experience we headed to the cablecar. It took as way up to the 3800m altitude. From the very beginning the view of the icy desserts was astonishing. It was crazy to think that I'm actually going to pass over it, climb peaks here and even stay overnight, because I am not really a big fan of cold weather. But the idea to face the fear of cold and make it more controllable was fair enough to take that challenge!`}</p>\n    <p>{`We roped up, put on our crampons and headed for the adventure through the snowy dessert to climb the Pollux and Castor peaks. Blindingly bright snow reflecting the sun, voracious crevasses, cracking ice sounds over the valley and overall exposure of the Alps can't leave you without impression. It's at the same time heavenly beautiful and dangerous as hell. Few hours walking through this paradise passed very quickly and we reached the Pollux mountain and started ascending it. There we felt very clearly that it's way harder to do high intensity activities without proper acclimatisation. It was my first experience climbing with crampons and ice axe, at first it was quite unstable, but after some time I get used to it and enjoyed the ascend.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Climbing Pollux took us longer than expected so we decided to skip Castor peak and go straight to Ayas hut - two more hours hiking through the glacier. Before the sunset we arrived at our place of stay for the night, tired but happy. Sleeping at 3420m elevation was a bit unusual, felt light headache and surprisingly it was quite hot in here. Overall, got a quite good sleep and was ready for the next day adventure!`}</p>\n    <p>{`The next day in the morning weather looked good, just a little cloudy so we decided to go for Castor and then maybe even take another peak - Breithorn. But after some hours of walking nature decided to play around with us a bit :) Around 15m/s wind started to blow and cloudy sky became complete whiteout where you can see only 5-10 meters around yourself. It was interesting to observe myself in those extreme conditions, my mind becomes much more sharp and focused, without any irrelevant thoughts I scan my body and make right decisions to move as efficient and comfortable as possible. The walk itself after the night at high altitude became much easier, organism adapted to decreased oxygen level very well. It basically became a meditation, just calmly walk through the nothingness, concentrate only on the present moment and fix any uncomfortable feelings that arise. We obviously skipped those peaks we planned to ascend that day, was too dangerous and 5-6 hours hike with those weather conditions was good enough to feel the power of pure wild nature.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Even though we already experienced enough to be proud of this journey, the biggest challenge was waiting ahead. After analysing weather forecasts and our current condition we decided to take one rest day and then go for our main goal, the Matterhorn. Many lessons were learnt during our preparation hikes. One of them may sound ridiculous, but it's really bad idea to ignore the sunscreen on a glacier when you even can't see the sun. Fog around you and the snow reflects sunbeams in all directions and you are basically walking in an overpowered natural solarium! Another one is how dangerous it would be to walk on the glacier alone. Never do that! Crevasses are very dangerous and you would never know when another one would open just below your feet. In fact, even though we were walking on a settled path, @Ignas, as a leader of our group of two (one who walks first), fell into crevasse twice! Nothing serious happened, only fell up to his torso, but it still shows the risk of those beautiful silent killers.`}</p>\n    <p>{`And so the day has come to approach the Swiss legend. The plan was to take a cablecar to 2583m height, hike up to Hornli hut at 3260m, stay there overnight and on the early morning assault the Matterhorn peak (4478m) and come way back to cablecar by 17:00. Everything has started just perfectly. Despite the ending of the summer climbing season the weather was perfect for climbing Matterhorn, there were any clouds, sun was shining, temperature was not too cold and our body condition was at it's peak after a good rest day. First day we approached Hornli hut in no time, we arrived even faster than planned, settled here down and decided to warm up a bit and try first 1-2 hours of climb that is waiting tomorrow.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It was so exciting to approach the first steps of the climb and realise that you are at that point where you no longer can change anything too much. We did everything we could to prepare for this and now it's time to test out are those countless hours spent will pay off or you'll have to retreat and come back again next year stronger and wiser. That test run of few hours added even more confidence for us. The rock seemed solid and fun to climb, body worked as a Swiss watch, simul climbing technique was quite comfortable even though we never tried it before. Only one bigger concern was path finding. It was quite hard to find the right path and not get into too steep climb section or step onto loose rocks. But there will be more climbers trying to conquer the Matterhorn tomorrow, mostly with the guides, so that problem seemed to be easily solvable by following someone on the go. Overloaded with tons of positive emotions we headed back to the hut, spoke some rubbish with other roommates that are going to take the same challenge and went to get some sleep before the final countdown.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are some quite strict rules climbing Matterhorn from the hut. You can't just randomly ascend it whenever you want, there is defined time when you can start, at the end of a season it was quite late - earliest time was at 4:50. Also one more rule - groups with Swiss guides go first, then groups with other country guides and individual groups go last. Those all rules make sense to ensure the efficient and safe climb for everyone, but that definitely didn't help us to achieve our initial plan and it was quite obvious that we will not make it until 17:00 o'clock to the cable car. But there were other option like to stay at the hut for one more night or just descent way back to Zermatt (1608m) which is kind of hardcore, but doable, so we didn't bother to much about that.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We woke up at 4:20, had a breakfast, prepared all gear needed and headed to the start of the climb. We knew that there will be small jam at the beginning because there were around 20 other groups climbing, mostly with guides and first section is steep and slow with fixed ropes, so we were not in a big rush as we will still climb last. Standing in a queue for the climb was a bit nervous, many random thoughts came to my mind, but as soon as we started to climb everything just vanished. Love so much that feeling of focus and clarity of what to do next while climbing. It is so awesome when your body, mind and feelings supplement each other and all contributes to the same goal.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Our pace was super fast, we run through the first half of the climb in no time beating all our expectations. Following rushing guides with their clients and random roommates shouts \"Go, go, room number 12!!!\" surely helps to keep motivation up and not give up when it gets harder. We did a small rest by the emergency Solvay hut (4000m), enjoyed stunning view of the landscape and made ourselves ready for the final vertical meters of the climb. This part was much steeper, more difficult technically and we already felt a bit tiredness after so intense climbing. Our pace slowed down a little, we dropped behind a bit from the main group we were following and that's the point where things get a bit more interesting. :)`}</p>\n    <p>{`\"Rock!!!\" - never heard Ignas shouting this word so seriously. We often encounter small falling rock while rock climbing, but most of them are not significant to worry about and would give you a bruise on contact at most, despite this fact it's still a good habit to warn everyone about incoming dangers. But that one was from a different league. One that could easily wipe off few people at once! Gladly it passed by me and another group that was climbing behind us and everyone stayed safe. That was a good indicator that we should be extremely careful with our chosen path as rocks are very fragile even few meters off the main track and that could be fatal not only for us, but for others as well.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A little bit shocked but determined to finish our challenge we proceeded with our climb more carefully.
